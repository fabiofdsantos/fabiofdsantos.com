Hey there! I'm FÃ¡bio, a software engineer who cares about using the best practices to build products and services. Besides my engineering background, I try to have always the customer in mind and put all my effort to push the team to achieve the best results.

I have experience in both startup/non-startup environments and various sizes of companies. Because of that, I had the opportunity to shift (even partially) between multiple roles and responsibilities during my professional life: software architect, developer, team lead, devops, system administrator, solution designer, product owner, hiring and executive responsibilities.

I hold a Bachelor/Master's in Computer Engineering and currently pursuing a Master's in Information Management. Eventually, I would like to pursue a PhD but still not sure about the research topic.

Besides my professional life, I enjoy traveling, exercising (almost everyday), learning about other cultures and trying new stuff (e.g. radical activities such as skydiving).

I'm always looking for opportunities to work with smart people on awesome projects, so feel free to contact me: me@fabiofdsantos.com
